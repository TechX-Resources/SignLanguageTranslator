# SignLanguageTranslator
Millions of people around the world rely on sign language as a way of communication, however, there are even more people who don’t even understand the basics. The main issue is that 	effective learning is often limited by a lack of real time feedback and interactive practice partners. Traditional resources like books, flashcards and prerecorded videos can’t correct mistakes, answer questions, or adapt to individual learning needs. As a result, learners struggle with motivation, proper technique, and conversational fluency.
This project aims to build an AI-powered sign language tutor chatbot that uses computer vision and a large language model  to provide real time, personalized feedback, corrections, and conversational practice.
The system will guide users as they sign in front of their webcam, instantly analyze their gestures, and offer encouraging, adaptive tips making sign language learning more engaging, accessible, and effective.
